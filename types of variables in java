there are three types of variables in java
1) local
2) instance
3) static


there are two types of datatypes in java
1) primitive :- boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float, double
2) non-primitive :- classes, interfaces, arrays


Normally, an array is a collection of similar type of elements which has contiguous
memory location
•Arrays in Java work differently than they do in C/C++.
•In Java all arrays are dynamically allocated.

eg :- int arr[] ;
      arr = new int[20];
      or
      int[] arr = new int[20];
