Features of Java

1. Simple
Java is easy to learn and understand. It has a clean and easy-to-read syntax, similar to C++, but removes many complex features like pointers and operator overloading.

2. Performance
Java's performance is good because the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) compiles bytecode to native machine code using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers. Though itâ€™s not as fast as C/C++, it balances performance and portability well.

3. Secure
Java is designed with security in mind. It has features like bytecode verification, runtime security checks, and a security manager that helps in building virus-free, tamper-free systems.

4. Object-Oriented
Java follows the object-oriented programming paradigm, making it easier to manage and modify code. Key concepts include classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.

5. Interpreted
Java source code is compiled into bytecode, which is interpreted and executed by the JVM. This makes Java platform-independent.

6. Multithreaded
Java supports multithreading, allowing multiple threads (smallest units of a process) to run concurrently. This is useful for tasks like animations, real-time games, and server handling.

7. Portable
Java code can be written once and run anywhere (Write Once, Run Anywhere). As long as the system has a JVM, it can run Java bytecode regardless of hardware or OS.

8. Distributed
Java supports networking and remote method invocation (RMI), allowing programs to work across the internet and share objects and resources easily.

9. Robust
Java emphasizes early error checking, runtime exception handling, and garbage collection, which makes it reliable and less prone to crashes.

10. Dynamic
Java programs can adapt to evolving environments. It supports dynamic memory allocation and can load classes at runtime, enabling dynamic linking and loading of new code.

11. High Performance
Although interpreted, Java is optimized with the use of JIT compiler and efficient memory management, which enables high performance compared to other interpreted languages.
