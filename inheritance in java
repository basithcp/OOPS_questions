Economy of time:
When you implement Employee, you already have all
functionality of Person. No need to reimplement
Parameter passing:
If you have a function that expects a Person, you
can pass an Employee, and it is still fine.

Container classes (linked lists, binary trees, etc.) can be defined to hold a
Person, and can hold any subclass of Person


*by default all classes, inherits Object class



TYPES OF INHERITANCE

1) Single Inheritance
2) multilevel inheritance
3) hierarchial inheritance
4) multiple ( through interfaces in java) inheritance
5) hybrid inheritance


Object References and Inheritance

A superclass reference
can refer to an instance of the superclass OR an
instance of ANY class which inherits from the superclass

eg:-

BankAccount anAccount = new BankAccount(123456, "Craig");
BankAccount account1 = new OverdraftAccount(3323, "John", 1000.0);

while calling account1.withdraw() , the function will be determined only in runtime yields run time polymorphism
