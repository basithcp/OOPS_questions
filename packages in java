•  java package grouping a number of related classes and/or interfaces
together into a single unit That means, packages act as containers for
classes
•  Package in java can be categorized in two form , built in package and
user defined package.
•  There are many built in packages such as java, lang , awt , javax , swing,
net, io , util , sql etc.


•  The benefits of organising classes into packages are
-  The classes contained in the packages of other programs/applications
can be reused
-  In packages classes can be unique compared with classes in other
packages That two classes in two different packages can have the same
name If there is a naming clash, then classes can be accessed with
their fully qualified name
-  Classes in packages can be hidden if we don’t want other packages to
access them
-  Packages also provide a way for separating design from coding
